# HX: an effect handler-oriented programming language

HX (pronounced /heks/) is a programming language designed for
*effect handler-oriented programming*, which is a programming paradigm
in which programs are syntax whose semantics are compartmentalised
into a collection of effect handlers. The separation of syntax and
semantics provides a modular basis for building software, where
programs can be retrofitted with more functionality whilst remaining
backwards-compatible with legacy code.

HX is influenced by programming languages such as
[SML](https://github.com/SMLFamily),
[Frank](https://github.com/frank-lang/frank),
[Helium](https://bitbucket.org/pl-uwr/helium),
[Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka), and
[Links](https://github.com/links-lang/links).
